# Dataset Collection
Many of our works are based on analysis and evaluation of real-world datasets. We have created an automated framework to collect datasets, extract columns from them, organize, and persist the records for further analysis. The framework could accept various input formats including csv, txt, JSon and MS Excel files. It also supports recognition of column data type for unattended data collection. For further analysis purpose, the framework provides API enabling customized features to be extracted from the columns.

Using this framework, we have collected around 20000 columnar datasets from approximately 1200 tables with a total size of 500G data. These datasets are all from real-world data sources and cover a rich collection of data types (integer, date, price, address, etc.), with diverse data distributions. 

Here's a list of data sources the datasets are collected from. Please contact us if you need to download the datasets.
